title: Making music with the Moog Werkstatt and Hologram Microcosm

  So my current go-to setup is pretty simple. I create a simple sequence on the
  Keystep, send that to the Werkstatt using CV/Gate, then run the audio output
  of that into the Microcosm. As the Werkstatt doesn’t (yet) have a volume
  control, I have put a small Rakit mixer between the Werkstatt and the
  Microcosm, in order to fine-tune the gain coming through the chain; I’ve found
  that a hot signal will totally clip-out your audio output, especially when
  using any reverb, so I’ve found this to be a nice cheap and discrete solution.
  Finally, I have the Microcosm going out into a Volca Mix, and from there to
  Ableton for recording.


  Now, the benefit of having two mixers here, is that I can add another sound source into the Microcosm (i.e. merging with the output of the Werkstatt), or I can add a totally separate sound, not affected by the ambient Microcosm in any way - good for contrast options, drums etc. Or, I can have both.


  One thing I had to learn here was that the Volca Mix needed to fuel the Keystep sync tempo. This might be avoidable in a different setup, but here I need to activate the sequence on the V-mix before hitting play on the Keystep. This is no dramas, and actually adds another layer of potential, as I can now potentially activate a secondary sequence from somewhere else (e.g. a Behringer Crave).


  In terms of the performances I am doing, they are essentially one-track-takes of me playing with the various controls on both the Werkstatt and Microcosm, plus some volume control. I am seeing ways to slowly bring in texture from sparse to complex, and I have a couple of ways of naturally fading out any track by dropping the VCF cutoff to a point it no longer triggers effects downstream.


  This partnership of Werskstatt and Microcosm is just lovely for me. It has enough control options to keep you pretty busy (I can build in relaxed sips of wine at times), but is simple enough to set up quickly. Perhaps it is too simplistic? There are no drums or alretrative textures here. But I’m finding the stuff that comes through this process to be pretty nice and relaxing.


  Here’s a video showing the setup, as well as a quick run-down of some additional techniques, followed by a live jam.

This week we’ll **take** a look at all the steps required to make astonishing coffee with a Chemex at home. The Chemex Coffeemaker is a manual, pour-over style glass-container coffeemaker that Peter Schlumbohm invented in 1941, and which continues to be manufactured by the Chemex Corporation in Chicopee, Massachusetts.

In 1958, designers at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.spacefarm.digital) said that the Chemex Coffeemaker is _"one of the best-designed products of modern times"_, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

## The little secrets of Chemex brewing

The Chemex Coffeemaker consists of an hourglass-shaped glass flask with a conical funnel-like neck (rather than the cylindrical neck of an Erlenmeyer flask) and uses proprietary filters, made of bonded paper (thicker-gauge paper than the standard paper filters for a drip-method coffeemaker) that removes most of the coffee oils, brewing coffee with a taste that is different than coffee brewed in other coffee-making systems; also, the thicker paper of the Chemex coffee filters may assist in removing cafestol, a cholesterol-containing compound found in coffee oils. Here’s three important tips newbies forget about:

1. Always buy dedicated Chemex filters.
2. Use a scale, don’t try to eyeball it.
3. Never skip preheating the glass.
4. Timing is key, don’t forget the clock.

The most visually distinctive feature of the Chemex is the heatproof wooden collar around the neck, allowing it to be handled and poured when full of hot water. This is turned, then split in two to allow it to fit around the glass neck. The two pieces are held loosely in place by a tied leather thong. The pieces are not tied tightly and can still move slightly, retained by the shape of the conical glass.

For a design piece that became popular post-war at a time of Modernism and precision manufacture, this juxtaposition of natural wood and the organic nature of a hand-tied knot with the laboratory nature of glassware was a distinctive feature of its appearance.
